# DataScience-Solutions
It contains solutions of a lot of Data Science problems. Most of the problems I found on datacamp, Kaggle and anywhere else.

The datasets in this repository are of course structured. Some of these solutions maybe under development but some others are completed. 

This repository is for educational purposes so you can use my code however you like and feel free to contact me if you've some querries.
